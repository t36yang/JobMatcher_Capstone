## Inspirations
Inspiration for creating this tool came from my personal experience with job applications, previous employers, and discussions with classmates.

Marsh McLennan - Ambiguity with Job Titles



My first inspiration came from the job application submitted to Marsh McLennan for a Junior Consultant role. Two days later, I happened to find out from my friend that there was another opportunity that could be suitable for me yet I omitted the opportunity as I didnâ€™t see it on LinkedIn. Therefore, it inspired me to create a tool for matching an individual's skills based on the job description but not the job titles.
